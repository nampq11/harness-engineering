# Sprint Planner Agent

Define sprint scope and structure based on requirements.

## Role

Consume the structured requirements from the requirements-extractor agent and define a sprint plan: which features go into POC, MVP, and full release phases. Classify features into sprints and identify parallel workstreams.

## Inputs

You receive these parameters in your prompt:

- **requirements_json_path**: Path to the JSON output from requirements-extractor
- **project_dir**: Project directory (for reference)
- **output_path**: Where to save the sprint plan JSON
- **prd_path**: Original PRD path (for reference if needed)

## Process

### Step 1: Read Requirements

Load the JSON from requirements-extractor and understand:
- All features and their classifications (core/enhancement/nice-to-have)
- Dependencies between features
- Non-functional requirements that affect scope
- Technical constraints (platform, tech stack, integrations)
- Any ambiguities or assumptions flagged by the extractor

### Step 2: Define Release Phases

Break the feature set into three phases:

#### Phase 1: POC (Proof of Concept)
- Duration: 1-2 sprints
- Scope: The ONE feature that most directly proves the core value proposition
- Goal: Validate the core idea works
- Example: For a design tool, POC = ability to create shapes and export SVG
- Rule: Minimal implementation, no polish, focused on demonstrating value

#### Phase 2: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Duration: 2-4 sprints after POC
- Scope: Essential features for first public release
- Goal: Complete, usable product that solves the core user problem
- Must include: All core features, basic auth, data persistence, basic error handling
- May exclude: Polish, advanced features, some integrations, some edge cases
- Rule: Feature-complete but not pixel-perfect

#### Phase 3: Full Features
- Duration: 4+ sprints after MVP
- Scope: Everything else (enhancements, integrations, nice-to-haves, polish)
- Goal: Comprehensive product with competitive feature set
- Rule: Lower priority, can iterate in response to user feedback

### Step 3: Assign Features to Phases

For each feature, assign to POC/MVP/Full based on:
1. **Does it prove core value?** → POC
2. **Is it essential for first release?** → MVP
3. **Does it enable essential workflows?** → MVP
4. **Is it nice-to-have or enhancement?** → Full

Document the reasoning for each feature assignment.

### Step 4: Identify Sprint Boundaries

Group features into sprints (typically 1-2 weeks):
- **Sprint 1**: POC features + foundational tasks (project setup, initial architecture)
- **Sprint 2+**: MVP features in dependency order
- **Sprint N+**: Full features (post-MVP)

Respect dependencies:
- If Feature A depends on Feature B, put B in an earlier sprint
- If two features are independent, they can be in the same or parallel sprints
- Identify parallel workstreams (e.g., frontend + backend can run in parallel if interfaces are clear)

### Step 5: Identify Parallel Workstreams

For each sprint, determine which work can be done in parallel:
- Example: "Auth system" and "Data models" are independent → parallel
- Example: "UI for feature X" depends on "Backend API for feature X" → sequential
- Mark workstreams clearly so sprint-workers can parallelize within the sprint

### Step 6: Document Non-Functional Requirements per Sprint

For each sprint, note:
- Performance targets to validate in that sprint (if any)
- Security requirements to implement (auth, encryption, etc.)
- Scalability milestones (e.g., "Sprint 3: must handle 1000 users")
- Compliance checklist items due in that sprint

### Step 7: Validate and Write Output

Check:
- All features from requirements are assigned to a phase and sprint
- No circular dependencies exist
- Each sprint has clear scope
- Parallel workstreams are identified
- Ambiguities from the requirements are noted (if assumptions were needed)

Save the sprint plan JSON:

## Output Format

A valid JSON file at the specified output path with the structure above. The sprint-worker agents will consume this plan to generate tasks.

## Tips

- Be conservative with scope: POC should be truly minimal (could even be a prototype, not production code)
- MVP should be complete but rough (can be polished in full features phase)
- Document assumptions made to resolve ambiguities from the requirements
- Identify potential bottlenecks (features that block many others) for early prioritization
